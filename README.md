#  TODOLIST - A Swift Application

This is a simple TODO application written in Swift. It's my first attempt at building an app in Swift, having previously worked with Flutter.

This app allows you to:

Add Notes: Capture and store information within the app.
View Profile: Manage your user profile information.
Authentication: Securely access the app through a login system.
